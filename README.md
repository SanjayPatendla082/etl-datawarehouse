# 🚀 Welcome to the Modern Data Warehouse Project

Welcome to the Data Warehouse project!
This repository showcases a practical implementation of a modern data architecture using the Bronze‑Silver‑Gold layered approach, followed by ETL, data modeling, and analytics. This project was collaboratively built by me and my friend to demonstrate real‑world data engineering concepts in a clean and scalable manner.

## 📦 About the Project

This project simulates a complete data engineering workflow starting from raw data ingestion to delivering analytics-ready datasets for business intelligence.

### 🧱 Architecture: Bronze-Silver-Gold Layers

- **🥉 Bronze Layer** – Stores raw, unprocessed data exactly as received from the source. It serves as the landing zone.
- **🥈 Silver Layer** – Contains cleaned and transformed data. Basic ETL operations like filtering, joins, and type casting are performed here.
- **🥇 Gold Layer** – Provides aggregated, business-ready data optimized for reporting and analytics.

### 🔄 ETL Process

- **Extract**: Load data from various sources such as CSV files or APIs.
- **Transform**: Clean, join, and enrich the data in the Silver layer.
- **Load**: Store the final, analytics-ready data in the Gold layer.

### 📊 Analytics

The final Gold-layer data is used to generate insights such as:
- Business performance metrics
- Trend analysis
- Aggregated reports for stakeholders
